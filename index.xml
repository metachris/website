&lt;p>To interact with Ethereum smart contracts in Go programs, you need bindings for the specific type of contract.
This post is a quick guide for generating these bindings from various sources:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Manually compiled Solidity contract&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Smart contracts with Truffle (eg. &lt;a href="https://openzeppelin.com/contracts/">OpenZeppelin contracts&lt;/a>)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Compiling a contract on &lt;a href="http://remix.ethereum.org/">remix.ethereum.org&lt;/a>&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Using the Etherscan ABI API&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Prebuilt Go bindings&lt;/li>

These are often preferred over instantiating new threads for each task when there is a large number of (short) tasks to be done rather than a small number of long ones.
Suppose you want do download 1000s of documents from the internet, but only have resources for downloading 50 at a time. The solution is to utilize is a thread pool, spawning a fixed number of threads to download all the URLs from a queue, 50 at a time.</description></item><item><title>How to install Qt 5.6 and PyQt5 in a Python 3.4 virtual environment on Mac OS X and Linux</title><link>https://www.metachris.com/2016/03/how-to-install-qt56-pyqt5-virtualenv-python3/</link><pubDate>Thu, 24 Mar 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.metachris.com/2016/03/how-to-install-qt56-pyqt5-virtualenv-python3/</guid><description>This is a simple guide on installing the latest Qt (currently 5.6) and PyQt5 on Mac OS X 10.11 (El Capitan) and Linux with Python 3.4, inside a virtual environment.

iPhone developer Amro Mousa published a post yesterday with recommendations about how to reach a high average rating on the AppStore, since many app users are only remembered to rate an app on uninstalling, which naturally leads to less-than-optimal reviews and ratings.
The reality is some developers pay for downloads and reviews to get higher rankings on the App Store.</description></item><item><title>Scaling Python Servers with Worker Processes and Socket Duplication</title><link>https://www.metachris.com/2011/01/scaling-python-servers-with-worker-processes-and-socket-duplication/</link><pubDate>Sat, 29 Jan 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.metachris.com/2011/01/scaling-python-servers-with-worker-processes-and-socket-duplication/</guid><description>Developing servers that scale is usually quite tricky, even more so with Python and the absence of worker threads which can run on multiple cpu cores [1]. A possible solution are worker processes that duplicate the client’s socket, a technique that allows the workers to processes requests and send responses directly to the client socket. This approach is particularly useful for long lasting connections with more than one request per session.</description></item><item><title>Unicode and UTF Overview</title><link>https://www.metachris.com/2010/12/unicode-overview/</link><pubDate>Mon, 27 Dec 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.metachris.com/2010/12/unicode-overview/</guid><description>This post is a brief technival overview of Unicode, a widely used standard for multilingual character representation, and the family of UTF-x encoding algorithms. First a brief introduction to Unicode:
Unicode is intended to address the need for a workable, reliable world text encoding.
Unicode could be roughly described as &amp;ldquo;wide-body ASCII&amp;rdquo; that has been stretched to 16 bits to encompass the characters of all the world&amp;rsquo;s living languages. In a properly engineered design, 16 bits per character are more than sufficient for this purpose.</description></item><item><title>Advice for Android Developers: Prepare for App Acquisition</title><link>https://www.metachris.com/2010/12/advice-for-android-developers-prepare-for-app-acquisition/</link><pubDate>Mon, 20 Dec 2010 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.metachris.com/2010/12/advice-for-android-developers-prepare-for-app-acquisition/</guid><description>Here’s a brief but important advice for Android app developers: starting with your first app, prepare for the situation where a company wants to acquire one of your applications. Use a unique signing key (alias) for each app! Else you’ll be forced to either cancel the acquisition or hand out the key you use for other apps as well.
