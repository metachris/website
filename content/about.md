Hey there 👋
I'm Chris - aka metachris - a software builder who loves collaborating, dad of two, and living in Austria. I mostly write about software engineering, and occasionally bits about life.

---

Currently I'm at [Flashbots](https://www.flashbots.net/), where I contribute to engineering leadership and work with several teams and projects, including [BuilderNet](https://buildernet.org/) and [MEV-Boost](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost).

What draws me to Flashbots is the combination of amazing people, a mission I care about (keeping Ethereum decentralized by mitigating the negative externalities of MEV), and the open, collaborative nature of the org. Much of what we do is open source software, open research and open standards, heavily collaborating across the industry and ecosystem.

For more than two decades I've been part of open source communities across Europe - from one of the first hackerspaces here in Vienna (Metalab), to collaborating with the Chaos Computer Club and attending the Chaos Communication Congress, to being a key member of One Laptop per Child, working with Doctors Without Borders, and mentoring Google Summer of Code projects.

When I'm not at the keyboard I usually enjoy quality time with my kids and partner, often out exploring the Austrian Alps.

I'd love to hear from you, feel free to say hi!
