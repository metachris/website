Hey there 👋
I'm Chris - aka metachris - a software builder who loves collaborating, dad of two, and living in Austria. I mostly write about software engineering, and occasionally bits about life.

---

Currently I'm at [Flashbots](https://www.flashbots.net/), where I contribute to engineering leadership and lead work on [BuilderNet](https://buildernet.org/) and [MEV-Boost](https://github.com/flashbots/mev-boost), amongst doing a bunch of other things.

BuilderNet is a distributed, low-latency, TEE-based Ethereum block building network, which has been full of interesting challenges. Nowadays it builds about 30% of all Ethereum blocks.
MEV-Boost allows Ethereum validators to outsource block building to a competitive marketplace of specialized builders, enabling validators to capture MEV (maximal extractable value).

What draws me to Flashbots is the combination of amazing people, a mission I care about (keeping Ethereum decentralized by mitigating the negative externalities of MEV), and the open, collaborative nature of the org. Much of what we do is open source software, open research and open standards, heavily collaborating across the industry and ecosystem.

---

For over two decades I've been part of open source communities across Europe - from one of the first hackerspaces here in Vienna (Metalab), to collaborating with the Chaos Computer Club and attending the Chaos Communication Congress, to being a key member of One Laptop per Child, working with Doctors Without Borders, and mentoring Google Summer of Code projects.

When I'm not at the keyboard I'm usually having quality time with my kids and partner, and am often out exploring the Austrian Alps.
