The paper introduces an effective algorithm for secure, collaborative signature generation using threshold signatures, and an API-key based client/server protocol that allows user-specific limits and restrictions as well as key revocations and rotations.
The method supports all blockchains that use ECDSA and EdDSA signatures, which includes Bitcoin, Ethereum and the majority of popular cryptocurrencies.</description></item><item><title>City of Zion Project Report — June to August 2018</title><link>https://www.metachris.dev/2018/10/city-of-zion-project-report-june-to-august-2018/</link><pubDate>Sat, 06 Oct 2018 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.metachris.dev/2018/10/city-of-zion-project-report-june-to-august-2018/</guid><description>Redirecting to https://medium.com/proof-of-working/city-of-zion-project-report-june-to-august-2018-ea6fa87565ea</description></item><item><title>NEO dApps review - CoZ first dApps competition</title><link>https://www.metachris.dev/2017/11/neo-dapps-review-coz-first-dapps-competition/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.metachris.dev/2017/11/neo-dapps-review-coz-first-dapps-competition/</guid><description>Redirecting to https://medium.com/proof-of-working/coz-first-dapps-competition-dapp-review-3a6b284afaef</description></item><item><title>How to build an ICO on NEO with the NEX ICO smart contract template</title><link>https://www.metachris.dev/2017/11/how-to-build-an-ico-on-neo-with-the-nex-ico-smart-contract-template/</link><pubDate>Sun, 19 Nov 2017 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://www.metachris.dev/2017/11/how-to-build-an-ico-on-neo-with-the-nex-ico-smart-contract-template/</guid><description>Redirecting to https://medium.com/proof-of-working/how-to-build-an-ico-on-neo-with-the-nex-ico-smart-contract-template-1beac1ff0afd</description></item></channel></rss>
