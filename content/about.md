Hey there 👋
I'm Chris, aka metachris - a software builder, collaborator, and dad of two, working remotely from Austria.

I build high-performance systems and the teams that bring them to life.
I'm passionate about what's possible when technology meets great teamwork.

The best solutions don't come from solitary coding sessions - they emerge from aligned, motivated teams where people trust each other and ship autonomously. I focus on getting both the technical foundations and the team dynamics right.

This means: designing systems that make sense to everyone, fostering clear communication, establishing tight feedback loops, and creating space for teams to move fast without cutting corners.

## What I'm About

Currently I'm at [Flashbots](https://www.flashbots.net/), where I work on blockchain infrastructure and tooling that helps create more transparent and efficient systems. I love the remote-first culture that lets distributed teams collaborate effectively across time zones.

I'm particularly energized by:

**Collaboration & Communication** – I believe the hardest problems in software aren't technical, they're human. Clear communication, trust, and psychological safety unlock team potential more than any framework or tool.

**Shipping Fast, Shipping Well** – There's a special satisfaction in rapidly iterating toward production-quality solutions. Small PRs, tight feedback loops, and incremental improvements beat big-bang releases every time.

**Growth Mindset** – I'm drawn to environments where people learn out loud, share knowledge generously, and view mistakes as opportunities. Whether it's mentoring teammates, writing documentation, or pair programming, I believe in growing together.

**Remote Work Done Right** – Remote work isn't just about Slack and Zoom; it's about intentional communication, async-first documentation, and building connection despite the distance. When done well, it unlocks access to amazing people worldwide.

## Beyond the Code

I'm a free software advocate who's spent time in hacker spaces and collaborative collectives. I find as much joy in a well-architected system as I do in helping a teammate unstick a problem or improving team processes.

When I'm not at the keyboard, I'm usually with my kids exploring the Austrian Alps, or thinking about building technology that makes the world a bit better. I'm cautiously optimistic about the future - realistic about challenges, and excited about what we can create together.
